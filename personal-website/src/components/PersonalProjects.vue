    <h1>Currency Converter</h1>
    <p>A console-based currency converter fully designed in Java. It uses a dual-API connection to achieve its functionality. 
        The first API is used to simply gather a list of currencies, while the second API gathers live exchange rates for 
        calculation purposes. A user can enter a base currency, a target currency, and the amount they would like to convert.
